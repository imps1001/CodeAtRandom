      <p class="mt-0" style="font-size: large; font-weight:200;">Education is all about self-awakening. We learn to augment our perspectives, 
        not only academically, but also to teach ourselves how to live. Importance of school learning 
        and the fundamental educational values our students draw from their early ages can never be 
        undermined, as this goes with them for through their life. Challenging literacy rate in India 
        and the alarming rate of school drop outs is a notable sample in how our education system needs 
        secondary support to keep feeding the students, so that they can work on the uncertainties and 
        excel in their own areas</p>
        <p class="mt-0" style="font-size: larger; font-weight:200;">We at Code At Random appreciate the fact that students these days undergo numerous 
          external challenges and influences, including that of lack of liberal learning approach. With 
          a purpose to contribute to our society, in a form of flexi learning arena, we introduce a one 
          stop destination for all your educational needs. We dream to provide you with the pre-eminent 
          quality of education on a low-cost online interactive platform, through pre-recorded learning 
          lessons, quizzes and game sessions, in a bid to explain every morsel of a module. Our 
          online-learning platform allows every candidate to learn at his / her own pace & interest. 
          At present we would like to facilitate students of Class 6th upto University level.</p>

      <p>There is never any point in the life of a person when he can sit back and say, <br>
<em>“There is nothing more to learn, I can relax with the comforting thought that the Universe around me is 
  an open book. I know it all.”</em></p>

      <p>We cannot firmly tell a child's future, but we can work on it; perhaps, I willingly take this 
        initiative not only to enhance your ward's knowledge in a particular subject, but also practically 
        as a whole through Code at Random.</p>

      <p>Currently pursuing B. Tech in a College affiliated with the Abdul Kalam Technical University 
        (Delhi NCR), I realize that education is not restricted to lessons taught in a classroom through 
        text books. Children must be encouraged to ask as many questions as they can.</p>

      <p>After struggling between what to do and what not to, I got myself a path to walk on and, 
        therefore, I want my juniors not to struggle with it!</p>
      <p><em> it is in wanting to know that will result in actually getting to know.</em></p>

       <p>Thanking you whole heartedly for the co-operation!</p>

          <p class="mt-5"> It is my dream to provide apt guidance and education to as many students at a 
            low cost since my graduation days. Therefore, I take this as a golden opportunity to provide 
            practical knowledge in every aspect through Code at Random.</p>

          <p>I am currently serving in an MNC based at Delhi NCR, dream to make every student of mine 
            prosper in his/her career. I firmly believe that children should not pay a hefty amount for 
            their own right to education.</p>

          <p>Perhaps, let us leave our footprints on the sand of time for others to follow and create a 
            different world – an educated world – which is at its best with practical knowledge. 
            <em> we do not have at our birth & which we need when we grow is given by education.</em></p>

          <p>I – along with you – aspire to develop you with the ability to make the right judgment to be 
            <em>'learned'</em> and <em>'educated'</em>, earnestly.</p>
